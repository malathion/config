#   A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of file names to be
#   ignored by pathname expansion. If a file name matched by a pathname
#   expansion pattern also  matches one of the patterns in # GLOBIGNORE, it is
#   removed from the list of matches.
# This lets you work around the infamous "I want to match all of my dot files, but not . or .." problem:
export GLOBIGNORE=.:..
