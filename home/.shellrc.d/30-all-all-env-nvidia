  # of the display devices; this may cause tearing corruption on the display
  #  device to which OpenGL is not syncing. You can use the environment variable
  # __GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE to specify to which display device OpenGL should
  # sync. You should set this environment variable to the name of a display
  # device; for example "CRT-1". Look for the line "Connected display
  # device(s):" in your X log file for a list of the display devices present
  # and their names. You may also find it useful to review Chapter 13,
  # Configuring TwinView "Configuring Twinview" and the section on Ensuring
  # Identical Mode Timings in Chapter 19, Programming Modes.
