#sublimetext <     weslly> | causasui: sublime currently doesn't have one, but you can use textmate 1.x to edit the themes in a GUI
#sublimetext <     weslly> | causasui: yep
#sublimetext <     weslly> | causasui: you can use it as a graphical .tmtheme editor
#pidgin <   EionRobb> | causasui: steam should go to all, not sure about AIM
#pidgin <   EionRobb> | causasui: that's kinda where I was heading with the pidgin-juice plugin, but I never got there
#pidgin <   EionRobb> | causasui: yeah, will need a plugin of some kind, unfortunately :)
#bash <      nDuff> | causasui: Not really -- permissions are part of your OS, not part of bash.
#bash <    greycat> | causasui: it's slightly off topic, but go ahead and ask
#bash <       blob> | causasui: go ahead and ask :x
#bash <    greybot> | causasui: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Permissions
#bash <    greycat> | causasui: ls -ld thething
#bash <      nDuff> | causasui: Have you logged out and back in since you were added to the group? Several operating systems require that.
#bash <    greycat> | causasui: it is group-owned by group #1 not group "logs".
#bash <    greycat> | causasui: and apparently your OS does not define a group name for group #1
#bash <     geirha> | causasui: The Permissions page explains that fairly well
#bash <    greycat> | causasui: chown changes the OWNER, and chgrp changes the GROUP.  Your directory was group-owned by the group with GID number 1 which had no name.
#postgresql <    mugwump> | causasui: sounds like a tricky and potentially open-ended project
#postgresql <  pg_lizard> | causasui : umm dont trust windows with mission critical data..
#postgresql <  pg_lizard> | causasui: viruses, data access permissions, reliability  and ofcourse speed.   Linux beats Windows in all those aspects
#postgresql <  pg_lizard> | causasui : yea then I would suggest  start with Postgers on Windows first. If you start seeing performance /security issues  then shift to Linux.
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: not really, only you can really do that - and honestly, C#.NET with MVC4 is really just fine
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: if you have an access db and your team is loving windows, just do a windows app and call it a day
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: the comparison between writing an app on windows vs linux
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: your specific needs may mean one is better
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: I'm responding to this "can anyone give an opinion of what costs and risks are associated with implementing a low-traffic (<10 users) mission-critical business database in Windows instead of linux?"
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: well either way if you're stuck with an "access" monstrosity, then I think that pretty much makes it clear that windows should be on your radar in terms of a toolkit for building this app
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: that's nice, then that requires the time it takes to convert to postgres and if you can hack .NET I just don't think it's worth it
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: if you can convince your boys to go with the rewrite of their already existing gargantuan data store, then cool, otherwise, just go with windows
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: define "can't"
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: MS Visual Studio (Express) is free
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: k, do you know any other languages you can do the app in?
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: uhh, no more unstable on windows than windows itself
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: which is why I'm saying to just go learn .NET and call it a day - it fits your specs
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: on windows, if you need reliability and stability, choose windows technologies
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: long story short, I can almost guarantee you can expect some quirks, glitches and unstabilities running postgres as a production server on windows vs on linux
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: well if you're stuck with windows, then there's no real good way to do that and achieve "reliability" for a "business app that's uber important and so needs reliability"
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: you'll be better off sticking with something windows related for now, and tackling a rewrite of the entire system for linux later
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: so if you don't mind changing the topic a tad, do you have any other doman knowlege of other programming languages?
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: well if you do actually know all that, then seriously, my friend, learning C#.NET will be a breeze
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: C#.NET is actually pretty nice, and of course you can do C++.NET
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: I actually really enjoyed some of the socket programming I did in C#
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: it's really quite elegant
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: and as I said, Visual Studio is free
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: at least, the express version is free, and it has everything you'll need to actuall compile and deploy applications
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: oh, um… wait, you said you had an access db already?
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: this changes things, so you don't have an access db, you're converting some pre-existing data set INTO an access db?
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: what is the ORIGINAL format
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: aight well, the fact is, that there IS a large amount of stuff that's very windows centric
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: really what you should be doing, IMO, is migrating from Access SQL-Server
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: unless you can convince them that you'll be able to and will gladly support postgres for them
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: but then again I guess your domain knowlege is in the OSS world, so learning C# is an overhead
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: cool, then go with postgres I suppose, but you'll have to more than likely convert the mail server etc anyway
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: I think you should just bite the bullet, either way, no matter how you slice it, there's going to be extra overhead in converting SOME part of this system eventually
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: postfix works well for me
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: uhh, not sure - it might exist
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: hell, IIS can send email
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: but again, this is what I'm saying - you're gonna have road blocks no matter what, really
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: if I were in your shoes, I'd probably do one of two things, I'd either rewrite AND host on linux, or I'd just stick with windows
#postgresql <     cartan> | causasui: our product uses postgres as a db backend. On windows. For years. No problem.
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: for real, you can meet all their needs afaik with a linux server, and if you can set it up and it works, what reason would they have to say no other than "we don't understand it cuz it's not windows"
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: actually it's not such a great idea from my very real world experience
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: virtual machines are notoriously finicky
#postgresql <     cartan> | causasui: most people who constantly whine how bad everything related to Windows is probably haven't used any of it since Windows 95
#postgresql <     cartan> | causasui: I don't understand the question
#postgresql <   Snow-Man> | causasui: so make sure you've got proper backups
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: and if you are a good boy and you set up proper backup procedures
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: then it's all a moot point anyway, so just go with a postgres
#postgresql <     cartan> | causasui: ooooh, I wasn't familiar with »WAPP«.  We use no Apache and no PHP.  It's not a web app.
#postgresql <   Snow-Man> | causasui: there's a lot of people using PG on Windows
#postgresql <     cartan> | causasui: never
#postgresql <     cartan> | causasui: no, not web facing.  It's a production system.  maybe 100 clients in a LAN, working 24/7
#postgresql <     janos_> | causasui: may not be an option, but i run things in stealth mode for months if not a year before i put my neck on it ;)
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: if you go with a VM, be sure not to install ANY system updates until you know they don't break your virtualization software - I just had that problem… still do actually :(
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: you wait
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: this is one reason businesses are often loathe to update anything
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: cuz if need a reliability guarantee, however small - you basically can't install updates, or you need to set up a secondary system that mirrors the first where you install the update
#postgresql <  eph3meral> | causasui: yep basically

and` hi!
and` did you load the theme correctly? :)
and` you need to setup your console as well to have a black background
and` yeah, you need to /set theme theme_name
and` otherwise it'll be set to default
and` you also need the xchat plugin for the nicknames
and` yeah, you can drop the default one
and` yup!
and` you need https://github.com/averi/config-files/blob/master/irssi/scripts/xchatnickcolor.pl
and` no, it should work without restarting, add it to the startup dir
and` otherwise it won't be loaded by default
and` there's still smth wrong on the image, the "acts", I removed them in my config
and` the startup directory is named autorun and should go into scripts/
and` load awl too :)
and` make sure all the plugins are loaded
and` so they got loaded already 
and` you should see each nickname with its own colour
and` do a /nicklist screen
and` and load the nickname's list on your right sidebar
and` look above :)
and` if you loaded the relevant plugin as you said before, do a /nicklist screen
and` and you'll have it
and` I can see if I have a screenshot of the fonts used there
and` http://www.dragonsreach.it/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/fonts.png for your reference :)
and` it's italian on the old good GNOME 2.x :)
and` if you need any help just ping me anytime, glad to help out ;)
and` are you on bash?
and` creating a nice .bashrc / profile is not that easy, I have a few bookmarks but I usually leave the default values
and` I just tweak the background color or the font directly on the gui nowadays
and` what I add are a few aliases for my Debian packaging stuff
and` yeah, I didn't find any good blog post about this topic too 
and` I should probably write one but no time to investigate further on the topic :)
and` :) are you a wikipedia writer?
and` admin of the international wikipedia?
and` wow
and` that's nice
and` yeah, but I don't think they give admin's status to everyone out there, so congrats :)
and` yw :) drop me an e-mail if you'll post smth about consoles color codes etc
and` have a nice day!

#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: read that
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: and you need either polkit from testing... or rebuild the one from extra and add the --enable-systemd=yes to the configure from abs
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: or, you can take my advice
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: because it is the solution to your problem
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: Don't ask to ask, or if anyone is here or alive or uses something. Just ask your question and let's get moving along, k? Thanks.
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: Post the _exact_, _verbatim_ error message. Paraphrasing, reciting from memory, or otherwise being vague will earn you a swift boot to the head.

#archlinux @gtmanfred| causasui: i gave you the answers
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: did you compile polkit 105 from abs
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: did you rebuild polkit from extra
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: if you just followed that blog post and didn't rebuild polkit
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: pacman -Qs 'alsa|pulse|oss'|curl -F sprunge=@- sprunge.us
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: yes
#archlinux @gtmanfred| causasui: did you rebuild polkit 105?

#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: you can try it, then answer yes or no?
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: it shouldn't for suspend
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: you are launching x with startx?
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: wait... you did say you were using systemd didn't you?
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: error msg?
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: ahh... you aren't booting with systemd...
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: go setup systemd
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: cat /proc/1/comm
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: i know exactly what the problem is
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: your best solution is to use systemd
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: are you actually booting with systemd?
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: well your error message sounds like you arn't booting with systemd
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: it isn't magic, just installing it doesn't do anything

gtmanfred no...
gtmanfred optimus is a nvidia+intel video card
gtmanfred 2 in one
gtmanfred ok
gtmanfred how do you start x?
gtmanfred dm?
gtmanfred with the .xserverrc?
gtmanfred oh remvoe --with-ck-launch
gtmanfred you don't need it anymore
gtmanfred it might
gtmanfred but you don't need it anymore
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: please talk in here
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: what happens?
gtmanfred try startx now, and talk in #archlinux
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: right, that is why I asked you to talk in here
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: mind pastebin your .xinitrc?
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: can i still see it?
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: what?
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: oh, you can pastebin from the commandline
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: An easy way to pastebin output from the command line. Pipe your output via curl to the sprunge pastebin: <command> |& curl -F sprunge=@- sprunge.us
#archlinux  phrik| causasui ping
#archlinux  phrik| causasui use ix.io: <command> |& curl -F 'f:1=<-' ix.io ---- or get the client: curl -O http://ix.io/client
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: yes
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: because its a black bbox
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: but if you're so smart, you should be able to figure this out on your own
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: or maybe we want to look at the common problems about how things change based on which init you are using
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: like using consolekit
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: well you seem to act like you are
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: why the hell do you have to move a window?
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: how are you moving a window right now if X isn't starting
#archlinux  thebilgerat| causasui: have you considered a window manager like dwm or xmonad?
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: then start your window decorator
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: thats even _more_ reason to see .xinitrc
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: where else do you start a window mnager
#archlinux  jaake| causasui: spectrwm :)
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: no i fucking havent
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: for fucks sakes, you have no window manager running and you're refusing to show us the files where you start the window manager
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: you understand how idiotic you're being?
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: then what the fuck is your window decorator
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: WELL BE FUCKING SURE
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: oh lol
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: WHAT IS YOUR WINDOW DECORATOR
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: go find out
#archlinux  KaiSforza| causasui: figure out what the heck you're using. or let us do that.
#archlinux  KaiSforza| causasui: use sprunge, and post your xinitrc here.
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: yes... help me fix my system... but god forbid you get any details
gtmanfred i didn't ban you ask him
gtmanfred the person who banned you
vodik we're only so patient
gtmanfred i didn't ban you
gtmanfred so?
gtmanfred i didn't ban you take it up with him
gtmanfred well fucking wait
vodik oh, thats how you want to play it? look, you're an ass. you're asking for help, but you offer nothing. you don't listen, you don't give us anything (and we do this all day, we know our shit), act like you know better? fuck off
gtmanfred now stop or i will extend the ban
vodik there are other people we're better serving our time helping
vodik thats because you got your head yp you add
vodik *up your ass
gtmanfred stop messaging me and wait for vodik to respond
vodik oh, no, i don't take this personally at all. theres simply a point where enough is enough
vodik and thats relevant how?
vodik why is it increadibly difficuly?
vodik you have a tty
vodik you have 6 of them
vodik don't do it inside X
vodik yeah, except people have different knowledge sets
vodik and not everyone pays attention to the 10-15 different conversations going at once
vodik so thats a very typical experience
vodik you realize YOU did this first
vodik I asked you to pastebin .xinitrc, I didn't KNOW you've done this before, and what do i get? "I will strangle you"
vodik so fuck off
vodik seriously
vodik how do you think I should handle that?
vodik oh is your frustration an excuse?
vodik something you can hide behind?
vodik right
vodik so just move on
vodik its only a few hours
vodik 2 i think
vodik cool off, come back later
vodik i have to go back to studying, im on break for only another 5 minutes, but if you promise to be more cooperative (i know you may not like doing this over), i'll drop it
vodik well, im gonna put it this way. its very apparent you don't have a window manager running
vodik thats why you can't move windows
vodik thats why you don't have decorations
vodik where do you start a window manager? .xinitrc
vodik so its a very logical place to start
vodik xorg log tells me nothing
vodik clearly X is starting
vodik and running
vodik just fine
vodik whats in ~/.config/autostart/ ?
vodik right, you're xinitrc looks _mostly_ good
vodik tagentally, xset m 0 4
vodik and
vodik setxkbmap dvorak
vodik will never run
vodik put those before exec ...
vodik exec does some magic, it replaces the process, it doesn't spawn a child
vodik kk
vodik causasui: can you switch to a tty right now?
vodik while x is running?
vodik causasui: k, do that and run this command
vodik DISPLAY=:0 xfwm4
vodik you may need to add --replace too
vodik that should manually start the window manager
vodik work?
vodik oh, you can do that there too, then you don't need the DISPLAY=:0 bit though
vodik i wasn't sure if you could open that without the window manager running
vodik then do it in the tty
vodik xf <- xfce. wm <- window manager. 4
vodik xfwm4
vodik just remember it like that
vodik DISPLAY=:0 xfwm4
vodik ah
vodik pacman -S xfwm4 and try again
vodik for some reason you don't have it installed
vodik its an environmental variable, not a command
vodik its a bash thing
vodik try
vodik whereis xfwm4
vodik hmmm
vodik this is in a tty, right, not the launch program window, right?
vodik okay, just break it into two commands
vodik export DISPLAY=:0
vodik xfwm4
vodik oh, put it in quotes
vodik thats my mistake
vodik DISPLAY=":0"
vodik sorry
vodik sorry
vodik oh, no
vodik sorry just a sec
vodik sorry
vodik right, that won't actually have an impact
vodik so which line is "not a valid identifier"?
vodik no
vodik but i really don't know why it do that, its valid bash
vodik kk
vodik because you don't need to do anything
vodik loginctl is integrated with pam
vodik so systemd knows when you login
vodik and can do all the behind the scenes magic
vodik of making sure you have access to your audio card
vodik mind pastebining loginctl?
vodik hmm, im not sure. im just gonna lift the ban so you can ask on archlinux since i've gotta get some other things done tonight
vodik night
vodik though i'll be around, just busy with school stuff
vodik you should be able to get into #archlinux

#postgresql  Berge| causasui: No, you can alter constraints at any time.
#postgresql  Berge| causasui: See the ALTER TABLE docs.
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: what it records is the absolute time
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: timestamptz values are _displayed_ in whatever timezone you set with SET TIMEZONE
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: semantically, it's equivalent to a unix time
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: the important thing is that now() always means "right now" regardless of any settings
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: no
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: let me give an example
#postgresql  JanniCash| causasui: you can set the session's timezone to whatever you need
#postgresql  JanniCash| causasui: like "set timezone to 'GMT';"
#postgresql  JanniCash| causasui: then all timestamptz output will be in GMT
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: but if Fred selects back his value, while timezone is set to 'Europe/London', and Jim selects his using 'America/Los_Angeles',
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: then Fred sees '2012-10-24 23:37:14+01' while Jim sees '2012-10-24 15:37:14-07'
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: no, this is ONLY for the type timestamp with time zone
#postgresql  JanniCash| causasui: if you set timezone to GMT, then now() would be something like 2012-10-24 22:40:00.0+00 right now
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: notice that those two returned times look different, but actually designate the same absolute time
#postgresql  JanniCash| causasui: if you set it to MET, it would be 2012-10-25 00:40:00.0+02
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: for example if you used extract(epoch from ...) to get the unix time, they'd be the same
#postgresql  JanniCash| causasui: that is exactly the same absolute time
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: this is why the rule of thumb is always to use timestamp with time zone when recording the time at which something _actually happened_
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: if his setting of SET TIMEZONE is different to yours, yes
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: you can think of timestamp without time zone as just storing the yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi:ss value
#postgresql  mugwump| causasui: http://pastebin.com/eH2EvM7T
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: (that's not what it actually does, but it behaves as if it did)
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: so there's no way to interpret a timestamp without time zone as being an absolute time without either knowing a timezone, or assuming one
#postgresql  mugwump| causasui: yes, I guess you might, but of course that means you can't specify which 2:30am you mean over DST changes
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: only if their timezone rules don't get changed between now and then.
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: every year, there are something like half a dozen or a dozen changes to timezone rules around the world.
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: right, scheduling apps require some attention to this sort of thing
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: you normally should store everything in absolute time.
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: the exception for future scheduling is because timezone rules change.
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: and if you stored the absolute time and the rules change underneath you, you'll get a wrong result with no way to tell.
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: depends how you decide the intervals
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: if it's "every hour" or "every 24 hours" then absolute times are fine
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: if it's "every day at local midnight", then you need to handle changes in local timezone, so future absolute times are no use
#mysql  thumbs| causasui: it depends on your actual question, but you might need to ask the perl folks
#mysql  thumbs| causasui: wait, did you say postgres?
#mysql  thumbs| causasui: you probably didn't mean to ask #mysql, then.
#sql  plushy| causasui: you have a bigger chance to get an answer if you write what the problem is
#archlinux  sudokode| causasui: just use lvm
#archlinux  Earnestly| causasui: The answer is yes, now go forth and learn
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: <Poetterix> drelyn86: The AUR is down in preparation for integration in the form of systemd-aurd and aurctl.  Do not be alarmed.

#archlinux  thestinger| causasui: pacman -Ql alsa-utils | grep service, you'll see they are already enabled
#archlinux  thestinger| causasui: does alsamixer open?
#archlinux  justinmc| causasui, are you in the audio group?
#archlinux  thestinger| causasui: turn off auto-mute

#archlinux  sailerboy| causasui, because you are out of memory?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: yes
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: the limit is 1600 columns
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: there's also the requirement that a row must fit in one block after toasting, which in practice often imposes a lower limit
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: what are you trying to do?
#archlinux  csc`| causasui, probably because its a trap.

#python  hiptobecubic| causasui, ipython + vim is excellent i think.
#postgresql  davidfetter_vmw| causasui, one of the awesome things about pg's MVCC is that you get to experiment pretty freely without ruining other people's data. one of the less-awesome things is that such experimenting can ruin their performance, sometimes long-term.

Shadowhawkins hi
Shadowhawkins what is it?
Shadowhawkins Why did you message me?
Shadowhawkins ah
Shadowhawkins sorry
Shadowhawkins I had a question on biology
Shadowhawkins may i ask?
Shadowhawkins well
Shadowhawkins You know what pun net squares are/
Shadowhawkins punnet squares?
Shadowhawkins ah
Shadowhawkins ok
#postgresql  lluad| causasui: Because it's easy enough to do, and if you don't apply it automatically you're relying on users or deployment folks to get it right when upgrading or installing a new machine, and they never do.
Shadowhawkins then

#postgresql  supplicant| causasui: what language are you using?
#postgresql  supplicant| causasui: just use manual scripts in version control for now and of course take backups
#postgresql  supplicant| causasui: that will work quite well
#mediawiki  sumanah| causasui: nice nick :)  where does it hang?
#mediawiki  sumanah| causasui: can you tell using ps or something what it's trying to do?
#mediawiki  sumanah| causasui: System Monitor or whatever they're calling it?
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, there are a *lot* of factors involved there. do you need your authentication and authorization systems tightly coupled?  unified across other functions?
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, yep
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, you *always* have to worry about hostile users, at least at some level
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, anyhow, there's a way to auth via the windows domain, but i don't know the details
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: the connected user ident obtained how?
#freenode  ss| causasui, ##crypto
##crypto  FauxFaux| causasui: A typical implementation of /dev/random uses sha512 to mix the output anyway.
##crypto  FauxFaux| causasui: Technically a cryptographic hash function (like sha256) loses a bit of entropy, so it's worse, but as a key it's probably way better than ascii text (i.e. you can't assume that certain bits are zero / letter frequency / etc.).
#gimp  felipe_Brz| causasui:  sorry
#python  tos9| causasui: Whatever you like.
#python  tos9| causasui: I use vim.
#archlinux  sudokode| causasui: try using labels or uuids
#archlinux  keenerd| causasui: The normal 'stuff was not actually written to disk' kind.
#archlinux  keenerd| causasui: The UPS bit seems suspect - where is this text?
#archlinux  keenerd| causasui: That makes no sense.  Anyway, disabling cache would 'help' just as much for non raid drives.
#archlinux  keenerd| causasui: How having a UPS would make things worse.
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: how huge?
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: that's tiny
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: lvm?
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: depends... lvm is a nice way to be able to edit things without downtime
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: but if one drive dies... might as well sit on your thumb
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: Are you setting it up for an office ? .. 
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: you need 9tb for personal use?... your forearms must be swollen.
#archlinux  Skry| causasui: ext4. lvm yes.
#archlinux  CMoH|notebook| causasui, lvm is a filesystem container; i'd use it
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: well lvm would make it act like 1 HD 
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: yes, but if drive 2 dies in the lvm.. how would you rebuild the filesystem?
#archlinux  Skry| causasui: lvm is on top of raid, as long as it's only one drive gone, you're fine
#archlinux  Skry| causasui: then again, if you get 2 failed drives you're fucked anyways with raid-5
#archlinux  CMoH|notebook| causasui, here's what lvm does: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_%28Linux%29
#archlinux  CMoH|notebook| causasui, i'd use ext4, but do read a bit on how to handle huge partitions - there are some flags that are used by mkfs (see /etc/mke2fs.conf)
#archlinux  CMoH|notebook| causasui, but for me, it's just theory... others here might have actually done it
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: i'm just making sure i've understood lvm 
#archlinux  Skry| causasui: there is no logic in that lvm would care about which one of the disks fail, that's why you have that raid in first place, to not to be (that) fucked up by a disk failure. I've used ext4.
#archlinux  Skry| causasui: raid first, then lvm, then filesystem. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/RAID https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LVM https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Software_RAID_and_LVM 
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Software_RAID_and_LVM
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: maximum size on a 64bit system... 8EB
#archlinux  Skry| causasui: np and good luck. and as a friendly suggestion, buy one more drive and go with raid10.
#sql  Twist-| causasui: you'll have better results searching for "junction table"

#sql  Twist-| causasui: the wikipedia articles on the topic are impressivley thorough, but read like stereo instructions.
#sql  Twist-| causasui: want a book reccomendation?
#sql  Twist-| causasui: Yeah.. I was just thinking.. I don't by stereos now. I get kickass speakers and an ipod.
#sql  Twist-| causasui: wait until you hit the relational algebra

#postgresql  lluad| causasui: Make the primary key a serial, then copy to all the other columns.
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, i'm assuming it's a SERIAL. just mention the columns you're populating in the COPY statement and leave out the SERIAL column
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, no. leave it out entirely
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, yep. it's not that hard
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, still not hard. you can do it with a catalog lookup and a little imagination
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, oh, and that table screams, "normalize me!"
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, there's a view called information_schema.columns
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, SELECT '(' || array_to_string(ARRAY(SELECT quote_ident(column_name) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' /* or whatever */ AND table_name='your_table' AND column_name <> 'your_table_id'), ', ') || ')'
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, does that make any sense?
#archlinux  demonicmaniac3| causasui: people are retarded like that
#archlinux  demonicmaniac3| causasui: there's even cavestory for wine in aur
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: yeah it has.
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: you can't do gpt with fdisk
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: use gdisk
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: fdisk can't understand gpt
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: yes
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: or parted
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: gdisk works almost the same as fdisk did
#foobar2000 +luckz| causasui: I vastly prefer foobar in wine to any lunix audio player I've seen
#foobar2000 +luckz| causasui: the user interface; lack of replaygain + lastfm scrobbling + support for all relevant formats in one product; maybe some streaming stuff. that's what I roughly remember.
#archlinux  sudokode| causasui: why are you setting up lvm?
#archlinux  sudokode| causasui: does it?
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: just treat md0 as a normal device then. you can mkfs it directly or make it a lvm pv 
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: yeah, with only 3 you're fine, but then why not just buy one more and do raid10 for MUCH better performance and reliability.
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: no parity
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: why do you need to dismount it if a drive fails? 
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: yeah. Less often when in a RAID5 array
#archlinux  yorick| causasui: most processes are running either as me or as root
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: on your RAID5 array? Nah.
#archlinux  yorick| causasui: that doesn't stay after reboots
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: I've never used it. Ask one of the btrfs fanbois here about it. :)
#bash  greybot| causasui (see the examples that start a shell): http://mywiki.wooledge.org/UsingFind
#bash  znDuff| causasui: -exec only calls the exec syscall -- doing redirection is a shell operator, so you need to have -exec start a shell, rather than directly starting gzip, if you want to be able to do redirection.
#bash  greycat| causasui: -exec sh -c 'gzip -9 -c -v "$1" > /foo/"$1".gz' _ {} \;
#bash  znDuff| causasui: Why would you need an alias for that?
#bash  znDuff| causasui: ...bash has built-in functionality for bypassing history; see HISTIGNORE
#bash  znDuff| causasui: sounds like a good use for HISTIGNORE, then.

#bash  nDuff| causasui: ...in that case it would be $'60\'.C1'
#bash  nDuff| causasui: so, instead of starting from syntax that you know doesn't work, how about describing what your desired behavior is?
#bash  geirha| causasui: quote ~ to avoid it being expanded
#bash  nDuff| causasui: not much reason to use cut for that at all.
#bash  nDuff| causasui: what's the larger context here?
#bash  nDuff| causasui: ^^ picking out the sixth item without using cut at all
#bash  nDuff| causasui: ...alternately, if you mean to use this in a pipeline, awk -F'~' '{print $6}' is another option (and lets you combine that with other in-awk logic for sorting/filtering/adding/whatnot).

#wikipedia-en  wctaiwan| causasui: no, I'm saying generally I think wikipedia's not worth the torture arbcom cases tend to be.
#wikipedia-en-admins  Thehelpfulone| causasui, shit's already flying, why not cause some more drama? ;-)
#wikipedia-en-admins  rschen7754| causasui: inactivity
#wikipedia-en-admins  Snowolf| causasui: because said leaker has access to highly confidential information for a month or so
#wikipedia-en-admins  Snowolf| causasui: well, a) the Board of Trustees intervenes or b) she gets her rights back and enwiki approves of the leaking
#wikipedia-en-admins  Snowolf| causasui: stewards remove stewards.
#wikipedia-en-admins  Fluffernutter| causasui: the trouble I see with assuming the election will resolve it is that this came out so late that much of the community won't have heard of it before they vote. She may well get re-elected on the basis of people *not realizing that she violated/might violate their privacy*
#wikipedia-en-admins  Snowolf| causasui: nope, not that way
#wikipedia-en-admins  Fluffernutter| causasui: indeed. But how would that be done? Forcing a posting into her questions asking her why she leaked or something? Even then, some voters probably don't even read the questions before voting. They *ought* to, but people are people
#wikipedia-en-admins  rschen7754| causasui: this sounds like some of the earlier leaks regarding FT2's re-election
#wikipedia-en-admins  Fluffernutter| causasui: my concern, again, is that the existing process doesn't actually exist. There's no good way to adequately disseminate information about her behavior in the next 12/24 hours. so it's not that I fear the electorate will overrule me, it's that i fear the electorate will elect her on what are basically false pretenses, which they'd learn too late
#wikipedia-en-admins  Snowolf| causasui: things are not done to be popular
#wikipedia-en-admins  Snowolf| causasui: uh, did the AMA support you? :P
#wikipedia-en-admins  Snowolf| causasui: well I personally think it's sad enough that we have to have one court, to create a full appeal and lower court system seems a bit excessive
#wikipedia-en-admins  Coren| causasui: I don't mind the "whip them for doing it wrong", it's the "whip them for doing it right, too" that's a bit hard sometimes.  :-)
#wikipedia-en-admins  Coren| causasui: I've yet to see ArbCom factor itself in a decision all things being otherwise equal.  It's usually tension between "those editors" and "the project", or "compassion for someone in trouble" vs "not therapy".
#wikipedia-en-admins  Ironholds| causasui: sure, you're structuring it as an AND. He was structuring it as >.
#wikipedia-en-admins  Coren| causasui: I don't believe injustice can really be hidden on Wikipedia.  Eventually, it'll pop up -- we can't "disapear" people after all, or control other venues.
#wikipedia-en-admins  Snowolf| causasui: mhm, and I think everybody would like for there to be no need for such things
#wikipedia-en-admins  Coren| causasui: It's a balance to be had.  There /is/ a responsibility that comes with being that influential.  But even if we could exercise absolute control /here/ (which we can't, owing to the number of eyes), we can't extend that control anywhere else.
#wikipedia-en-admins  Coren| causasui: And even then, our fundamental distrust made sure we could never have control here either.  Oversight leaves traces, and the next batch of people holding the rights can inspect the past.  Nothing can remain hidden.
#wikipedia-en-admins  Coren| causasui: Oh, I agree, and you'll find that -- as an institution -- Wikipedia is paranoid of supressing dissent and criticism of itself.
#wikipedia-en-admins  Coren| causasui: "Agressive"?
#wikipedia-en-admins  Thehelpfulone| causasui, are you new to this channel? I just noticed that I've never seen you before (I though you were someone that I knew hiding under a new nick)
#wikipedia-en-admins  Coren| causasui: Ah!  yes.  Questioning status quo is a positive thing, even if it leads to the conclusion of "It'll do".
#wikipedia-en-admins  Coren| causasui: That's why I defended the "joke" candidates on rejection-of-arbcom platforms in past years.
#wikipedia-en-admins  Coren| causasui: I was thinking Kurt, but yeah, same principle.
#wikipedia-en-admins  Fluffernutter| causasui: well, it truly is very hard to always rigidly adhere to exactly what the rules say, no more, no less. most admins don't do it (and in many cases we're *encouraged* to not do it)
#wikipedia-en-admins  Coren| causasui: Not so much harder, but very different.  Arbs are picked because we can cut the gordian knots and make a decision.  'crats are absolutely forbidden to do that and must completely set aside their opinion on the matter.
#wikipedia-en-admins  Snowolf| causasui: amusingly, I look at it the opposite way, I want 'crats to use their discretionary powers as much as they want, hence I'm concerned about the wrong people being 'crats xD

#archlinux  bioman| causasui: nothing wrong with that command
#archlinux  azradric| causasui: haha made my day :)
#archlinux  bioman| causasui: well, at work each time I had to run the service by hand, it never launches by itself at boot
#archlinux  bioman| causasui: Yeah, but no... Never had such a message before :/
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: eww
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: the debain wiki on systemd sucks
#archlinux  bioman| causasui: maybe it's because it tried to run before X is launched ?

#archlinux  iv597| causasui: /var/log/fail2ban something or other. I have it running on my VPS. Too lazy to look for the log right now but it's somewhere there and tells you who it just banned.
#bash  nDuff| causasui: if you're in tmux, you can log in through a second console and tell the tmux client to remotely detach.
#archlinux  evaryont| causasui: one that works. ix.io is nice, or sprunge.us
#archlinux  evaryont| causasui: nothing. it responds with HTTP 200 OK so it's fine

#archlinux  Apsu`| causasui: That's when you switched to systemd/journald?
#archlinux  Apsu`| causasui: No idea. Sounds like a fail2ban issue. Are you trying to block invalid ssh login attempts?
#archlinux  Apsu`| causasui: So setup iptables to use -m recent for new ssh connections and block for a brief period after x attempts in a given timeframe

#archlinux  bkc_| causasui: yes
#archlinux  sledgehammer| causasui, understand what you're doing, then decide, -d is "packages installed as deps", -t is "packages not required"
#archlinux  bkc_| causasui: and xorg-server isn't a dependency for anything so. go figure ^.^
#archlinux  bkc_| causasui: if it doesn't have a rev-dep it will be listed...
#archlinux  NiHP| causasui: I usually do pacman -Rsn $(pacman -Qtdq)
#archlinux  sledgehammer| causasui, ime removing stuff listed by -Qdt has never caused problems
#archlinux  sledgehammer| causasui, he installed it as a dep of something else which he has since uninstalled - not that complicated really

#sql  Twist-| causasui: sure.. but postgres on windows is also crossing the streams.
#postgresql  Twist-| causasui: did you run that trace?
#archlinux  Namarrgon| causasui: you won't get serious answers without providing error messages
#archlinux  Namarrgon| causasui: does it report more when you run it from console?
#archlinux  Namarrgon| causasui: you use the packages from the offical repos?
#archlinux  Namarrgon| causasui: recompiled it after the update?
#archlinux  Namarrgon| causasui: if deps for your 'pacman -Qm' packages change, you have to update your custom aur stuff yourself. make pacaur rebuild all of them.
#archlinux  Namarrgon| causasui: if it can, that is. i never used it.
#archlinux  Namarrgon| causasui: ok, but pacaur probably doesn't know when binary compatibility breaks on updates in the official repos.
#archlinux  Namarrgon| causasui: that's a bad "solution". just rebuild smplayer.
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, if you do need to rebuild smplayer - see the wiki on abs
#archlinux  Namarrgon| causasui: you might still have the old pkg in /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ but it will probably break other stuff.
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, abs is a simple way to rebuild standard repo packages

#archlinux  skyroveRR| causasui: I'll wait for 2 hours, and paste the report. But so far, how does my disk status look from the paste I gave you?
#archlinux  skyroveRR| causasui: one more thing: what does LifeTime(hours) mean?
#archlinux  Sicariuxs| causasui: i get this /Steam/steam.sh: line 287: 27689 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) $DEBUGGER "$STEAMROOT/$PLATFORM/$STEAMEXE" "$@"

#postgresql  davidfetter_vmw| causasui, this is probably not a forum where you'll find a lot of pgadmin3 users :/

#archlinux  nixin| causasui: which app is moving stuff to your trash
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: no, it is in $XDG_DATA_DIR, change where the env variable points
#archlinux  kristof| causasui: ...change /.local/share to symlink to somewhere on a magnetic disc
#archlinux  Boohbah| causasui: put your home directory on the SSD and symlink individual directories with large files stored on the HDD. that's my plan
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: ... don't symlink it
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: just chagne XDG_DATA_DIR it is a standard env variable which trash is using
#archlinux  thestinger| causasui: unless it's a really, really terrible SSD it's really pointless to try to minimize writes
#archlinux  Boohbah| causasui: why not just use rm?
#postgresql  linuxpoet| causasui: go for it
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: what happens when the user updates a column that _isn't_ the one with the constraint :-)
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: I think once you've worked out what's involved you'll drop it like a hot potato :-)
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: what's the point of a view then? just put the trigger on the table
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: for bonus points, the audit table can use hstore, which makes it trivial to query it for "when was column X changed to value Y"
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: or even just "when was column X changed"
#postgresql  cfedde| causasui: we don't usualy thing of database tables as "ordered"
#postgresql  cfedde| causasui: are you concerned about the value of a synthetic key?
#postgresql  cfedde| causasui: that's not a very rdbms way to do it.
#postgresql  cfedde| causasui: generaly we would generate the sequence on reporting.
#postgresql  cfedde| causasui: I'm just not sure what constraint you are trying to preserve.
#postgresql  cfedde| causasui: I think my ocd is conflicting with yours.
##linux  drpenguin| causasui: if the files are too big to fit in memory.. then maybe you should segment them and diff the segments
##linux  koala_man| causasui: do you want to sync to similar files, get a binary patch, or see if two huge files are equal?
##linux  koala_man| causasui: cmp will tell you where the files start to differ
##linux  koala_man| causasui: yes, though you can rerun it from a certain point
##linux  koala_man| causasui: you can also use something like comm -3 <(hexdump -v file1) <(hexdump -v file2) to diff hexdumps
#vbox  bekks| causasui: You have to be in the vboxusers group.

#postgresql  intgr| causasui: Yeah, pgAdmin's handling of backups is totally crazy.
#postgresql  Berge| causasui: No, there isn't. Use cron.
#postgresql  guzzlefry|1| causasui: NULL is neither true nor false
#postgresql  kjn| causasui: i believe postgresql will interpret 1 and 0 as valid booleans without a problem
#postgresql  kjn| causasui: and yes, putting a NOT NULL constraint on a column with null values will cause a problem
#postgresql  kjn| causasui: don't know about that, but may 't' and 'f' since that's postgresql's internal representation
#postgresql  kjn| causasui: however, you can maybe use a check constraint to get around it: check (foo is not null or not valid_column_flag)
#postgresql  kjn| causasui: where "valid_row_flag" is a boolean column you add, and can set to true when you've cleaned up the data in that row
#postgresql  kjn| causasui: a check constraint will ensure that a row always satisfies that constraint. this would include insert and update, which might be the only applicable cases.

##linux  socomm| causasui: firewall?
##linux  ikonia| causasui: firewall, port not forwarded correct, daemon has tcp wrappers
##linux  socomm| causasui: also can you access it from within your network - might be port-forwarding issue as already suggested by ikonia
##linux  drpenguin| causasui: you could wireshark your net, see why 8080 isnt getting traffic
##linux  socomm| causasui: port-forwarding issue most likely in that case
##linux  ikonia| causasui: what distro is this ?
##linux  socomm| causasui: that or your isp may be blocking said port
##linux  ikonia| causasui: drop iptables just incase
##linux  ikonia| causasui: I suspect it's portforwarding not setup properly though
##linux  qman__| causasui, iptables -F flushes rules, but iptables also has policies, which can be accept, reject, or drop
##linux  ikonia| causasui: whats listening on 8080 ?
##linux  ikonia| causasui: how are you testing the connection ?
##linux  ikonia| causasui: you testing the wan IP from within your network ?
##linux  ikonia| causasui: routing maybe a little messed up if it's on your own router
##linux  ikonia| causasui: check it from a random web-port-scan/connect type things
ikonia ok, let me have a quick look
ikonia I'll keep that url secret, I assure you 
ikonia ok, so confirmed it's down to the public internet
ikonia yes SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.1
ikonia just thinking
ikonia try it
ikonia don't think it should make a difference
ikonia I don't think it's a firewall anymore as 22222 is a non-standard port and that's working
ikonia any luck ?
ikonia no way
ikonia glad it's working
#postgresql  keithf4| causasui: not, just a reload
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: select pg_reload_conf();  is often more convenient
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: what OS?
#postgresql  keithf4| causasui: can you log in as a superuser? easier to just use the function i mentioned
#postgresql  keithf4| causasui: yes that's true if you're going to use the pg_ctl command
#postgresql  keithf4| causasui: how do you usually log into the database?
#postgresql  peerce| causasui; postgres is normally run as a service.   what OS are yu on?
#postgresql  keithf4| causasui: if you can connect locally with pgadmin3 as a superuser, i think you can just run "select pg_reload_conf()" in the sql command window there to apply the pg_hba.conf settings
#postgresql  keithf4| causasui: honestly not sure. not used pgadmin much. i would've thought it had some sort of place to type manual sql commands in it
#postgresql  keithf4| causasui: that doesn't sound like a pg_hba.conf issue. that sounds like you're connecting to the wrong port or it's not running on the port you want it on
#postgresql  keithf4| causasui: that actually requires a database restart to apply
#postgresql  keithf4| causasui: is the data_directory option active in the postgresql.conf file?
#postgresql  keithf4| causasui: hmm... what is the path to where your postgresql.conf file is located?
#sql  plushy| causasui: I don't have any idea
#sql  ||cw| causasui: access, and vbs specifically, does not handle null very well.  I tend to use a lot of COALESCE() when I have to use vb
#postgresql  lluad| causasui: He might be right in some ways, but "Create a shitty database to work around broken applications" is probably not the right answer.

#postgresql  pg_lizard| causasui  try the  query with column names
#postgresql  pg_lizard| causasui: you can benefit with an index on  ("timestamp"
#postgresql  pg_lizard| causasui   follow this sample snippet

#postgresql  pg_lizard| causasui   triggers are fired in the order of their names.  So just name them appropriately.

#postgresql  mwargh| causasui: how come? linux is the king of severs
#postgresql  andres| causasui: thats pg_dump output?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: because it doesn't store the original view text
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: the original where clause is converted into an expression tree which is stored; then when you dump it, the expression tree is converted back to source code that produces the same tree
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: so features of the original where clause, such as redundant parens, may be lost
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: no, because AND has precedence over OR
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui:  so  ((a and b) or (c and d))  is the same as  (a and b or c and d)
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: the outermost parens are needed, since you have  a and b and c and (d or e), but the inner ones aren't

#postgresql  Snow-Man| causasui: apparently you didn't
#postgresql  supplicant| causasui: except some columns? no
#postgresql  lluad| causasui: Nope. But ad-hoc views to filter output can be a useful hack occasionally.
#postgresql  davidfetter_vmw| causasui, you can generate such selects using information_schema.columns and a little creativity
#postgresql  davidfetter_vmw| causasui, you should probably fix that to make the column lists explicit. SELECT * can trip you up all kinds of ways, of which that's a pretty mild one
#postgresql  lluad| causasui: Explicitly listing the columns is probably your best fix.
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: you're changing it so that the columns don't match between the real table and audit table?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: the audit table would be just  foo_audit(id bigserial primary key, rec hstore)
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: and you'd do  insert into foo_audit(rec) values (hstore(OLD));
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: the really cool thing is that you can do things like have old_rec and changes columns, and do  insert ... hstore(OLD), hstore(NEW) - hstore(OLD)
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: if foo_audit has the columns of foo plus an extra audit_id, you can do  create table foo_audit_new as select audit_id, hstore(a) - 'audit_id'::text;
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: since hstore-text means "delete this specific key"
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: generating a changes list from existing audit data is harder but doable using lead() over ...
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: empty as in all null?  select null::text as blah from ...

#sql  plushy| causasui: you have an OR it that where clause
#sql  Xgc| causasui: plushy is correct.  The OR in the middle of your WHERE clause (at the same level as all the AND operations) is the problem.

#sql  plushy| causasui: still OR
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: ok, so the condition after the OR is the only thing that will let through rows where is_shipped is false

##linux  huttan| causasui: whats the purpose of the guest account ?
##linux  [R]| causasui: most dists set up a "guest account" to begin with
##linux  huttan| causasui: u can mange this with umask
##linux  huttan| causasui: set the default umask for /home/ to only have read access for the user and, not group and all
##linux  huttan| causasui: each user will be able to manage their OWN files this way
##linux  huttan| causasui: obvious the user itself will have write aswell
#postgresql  ilmari| causasui: foo BETWEEN date1 AND date2 -- beware that that's inclusive on both ends
#postgresql  linuxpoet| causasui: what does vlookup do
#postgresql  linuxpoet| causasui: that works too
#postgresql  linuxpoet| causasui: do both tables have a relationship? (like a customer_id)?
#postgresql  linuxpoet| causasui: or are you just looking for that budget number based on date range
##linux  [R]| causasui: ROFL
##linux  KittyPaws| causasui: LOL!
##windows  CyL| causasui: Give it a try here
#archlinux  webspid0r| causasui: mplayer -loop 0
##linux  [R]| causasui: you have to escape the !
##linux  [R]| causasui: \
#postgresql  lluad| causasui: IRC+pastebin works well. pgsql-general works well. stackoverflow is a crap-shoot for anything other than trivial issues.
#postgresql  lluad| causasui: There's also http://sqlfiddle.com , depending on what your issue is.
#archlinux  petantik| causasui: no; just new mirrors have been added
#archlinux  yorick| causasui: you should merge them
#archlinux  petantik| causasui: diff them to double check -> then merge
#archlinux  Scimmia| causasui, or just remove it if you're using something like reflector
#sql  plushy| causasui: the first one
#archlinux  petantik| causasui: probably okay
#archlinux  sheep| causasui: you can do that but remember to uncommend your preferred mirrors
#archlinux  lagagnon| causasui: When it comes to the mirrorlist I wouls suggest you use "reflector" to update the mirrorlist before running pacman -Syu. See the wiki on that.
#archlinux  tchebb| causasui: a case-insensitive fs will give you lots of issues
#archlinux  thestinger| causasui: 'case insensitive' would require it being aware of lowercase vs uppercase, which it can't be
#postgresql  dbb| causasui: insert into sierra.party(name_long,party_type_id) select principle_name...
#postgresql  Snow-Man| causasui: good example of why you should distinguish your variable names somehow
#postgresql  johto| causasui; "continue" in what context?
#postgresql  johto| causasui; not really. unless whatever context you're in decides to manually rollback the function's side effects, of course. but that would be silly
#postgresql  supplicant| causasui: indeed
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: there's no create or replace for triggers
#postgresql  ilmari| causasui: yes
#postgresql  ilmari| causasui: you can even do it in the same ALTER TABLE statement
##linux  Jonathan_L| causasui: do it in bash
##linux  ayecee| causasui: for the lulz
##linux  Jonathan_L| causasui: I told you! It's not a challenge otherwise!
##linux  zedboy| causasui: tagsistant.net
##linux  Jonathan_L| causasui: Also, to see the reactions of everybody who test it
##linux  Jonathan_L| causasui: Files encoded in base32, stored in one pair of tags each in XML in a variable, accessed with sed. The index is in the beginning of the variable
##linux  zedboy| causasui: no.
##linux  yermandu| causasui, pdfchain a gui for pdftk ;)
##linux  bls| causasui: only the perl version, not the util-linux version
##linux  Tramp| causasui: prename -n '!/\./ and s/$/.baz/' *
##linux  MrElendig| causasui: just use perl-rename
##linux  Tramp| causasui: not sure, what you're talking about, but yw.
#postgresql  mortehu| causasui: Can you create a column "legacy INTEGER DEFAULT 0" and some random values to the old rows, and create a unique index on (your_column, legacy)?
#postgresql  fmcgeough| causasui: could you have your new scheme for quote numbers be the primary key. Throw the old junky values into another column and then do reporting so that you pull the old junky values when you need to (they are there) and use the new unique values when they aren't?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: are all the new values greater than the old ones?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: if so, you can do  create unique index ... (quote_id) where quote_id > 123456;  -- or whatever the largest legacy value is
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: and add a trigger that prevents insertion of values less than that
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: uh, what?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: that index would guarantee that there were no duplicates larger than the specified value
##linux  MrElendig| causasui: man find, look at -samefile
##linux  MrElendig| causasui: also -inum
##linux  MrElendig| causasui: might not work reliable on all filesystems though
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: no
#postgresql  joevandyk| causasui: no
#postgresql  joevandyk| causasui: select pg_terminate_backend(pid) from pg_stat_activity where pid != pg_backend_pid();
#postgresql  joevandyk| causasui: pg_stat_activity shows all active connections
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, INSERT INTO legacy... SELECT ...
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, keep hacking away at it :)
#postgresql  depesz| causasui: ... > now() - '15 days'::interval
#postgresql  Qantourisc| causasui: UPDATE a SET column=True; (Might contain syntax errors)
#postgresql  Qantourisc| causasui: that's usually a NIGHTMARE :)
#postgresql  Qantourisc| causasui: when you write such a statement by accident :p
#postgresql  kjn| causasui: looks like you're comparing an integer to a timestamp
#postgresql  kjn| causasui: that would; you've changed your query so it's now comparing two time values
#postgresql  kjn| causasui: specifying the schema isn't necessary unless the objects aren't in your search_path
#postgresql  kjn| causasui: neither is qualifying created_date since you're only referencing one table in your FROM clause
#postgresql  supplicant| causasui: update tbl set col = (col || hstore('old_col', col->'old_col')) - 'old_col'; -- maybe?
#postgresql  supplicant| causasui: but I wouldn't do that
#postgresql  supplicant| causasui: you can figure it out with window functions after the fact I'm fairly sure
#ubuntu  zykotick9| causasui: my suggestion, pipe ls to a file.  then less the file ;)
#ubuntu  escott| causasui, tee to a temp file and cat the file at the end... there is only one standard out, you are describing routing to one stdout and in the background routing around less and back to stdout. which one should draw to console? the less or the second one
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: ls |tee >(less)
#archlinux  keenerd| causasui: What are you actually trying to do?
##linux  joshbaptiste| causasui: less -X
#archlinux  Earnestly| causasui: See the man page for less, look for "deinitialisation" iirc
#archlinux  keenerd| causasui: Anyway, rephrase the question.  Less and tee are not really made to do that.  Much simpler to run ls twice instead.  Eg, "ls --color=always | less -R; ls"
#wikipedia-en-admins  Superfreak| causasui: That just means everything was suppressed.
#wikipedia-en-admins  Superfreak| causasui: I'm not sure what you mean. It's not about transparency. You can't actually totally hide the revision anymore.
#wikipedia-en-admins  Superfreak| causasui: That's what I imagined it was.
#postgresql  cfedde| causasui: you will want to ensure that the virus software leaves your vm alone.
#postgresql  cfedde| causasui: most systems out there are highly under utalized.  On the other hand there are a few that are way over loaded.  those get the lion's share of the attention.
#postgresql  Qantourisc| causasui: iirc yes
#postgresql  tanj_| causasui: yes
#postgresql  Qantourisc| causasui: it is ? must have missed the start :p
#archlinux  nodame| causasui: Yes. It would be very rude.
#postgresql  Qantourisc| causasui: and i don't really mind :)
#python  jkyle| causasui: compared to what?
#python  jkyle| causasui: they're both in prevalent use.
#python  jkyle| causasui: you can learn 3.x and work in 2.7x pretty easily. if you're new to programming in general, mine as well learn 3 unless you have a very specific focus in mind, in which case look upt eh libraries for support
#archlinux  bezerker| causasui: Depends on how much maintenance you want to put into it.
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, depends how you do it
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, see archlinux 'lts' kernel, and also how to update/testbed upgrades
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, don't be put off, archlinux is great for servers, becuase security :)
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, sorry? you asking me?
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, it still depends on how you do it, and how much work you want to do.
#archlinux  kennae| causasui: arch should do just fine for that
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Compared_to_Other_Distributions
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Compared_to_Other_Distributions
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: This might help you decide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/FAQ#Q.29_Why_would_I_want_to_use_Arch.3F
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: Please read before upgrading: http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=57205
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: ◕ ‿ ◕
#archlinux  bezerker| causasui: I'd be curious to know their reasons for suggesting centos, other than it's a redhat clone and thus old legacy "stable" packages.
#archlinux  HACKhalo2| causasui: you shouldn't be
#archlinux  chvnx| causasui: I have no idea what you problem is.  Telling me you rebooted means nothing to me.
#archlinux  chvnx| causasui: what sound server do you use?
#archlinux  thrice`| causasui, which groups are you in?
#archlinux  chvnx| causasui: paste the output of the log to http://tty1.co
#archlinux  thrice`| causasui, try removing yourself from audio and trying again
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: Take your user out of groups for audio, etc. - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd#Supplementary_information
#archlinux  chvnx| causasui: paste the output of your logs first.  You may not need to remove yoruself from groups.  
#archlinux  Roukoswarf| causasui: relog
#archlinux  thrice`| causasui, have you rebooted recently ?  to be sure modules aren't confused
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: no
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: Don't ask to ask, or if anyone is here or alive or uses something. Just ask your question and let's get moving along, k? Thanks.
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: useless question
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: also you are lying.
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: I bet you have problem with audio and want help
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: if not, go to ##poll or similar
#archlinux  onexused| causasui: Seriously, though, when someone asks "has anyone had problems with foo", they usually have a problem with foo themselves - which is what it would be helpful to ask.  "has anyone had problems ..." isn't helpful usually.
##hardware  diki| causasui: i dont think so
##hardware  diki| causasui: If it was every second maybe, but not 30 mins
##hardware  jacekowski| causasui: a lot of raid controllers poll smart data whenever drive is idle
#archlinux  nikoJ| causasui: have you turned up your sound levels in alsa?
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: amixer |& curl -F sprunge=@- sprunge.us
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: nope, it wasn't muted, at that point i don't know, it also had enough stuff so it doesn't have pulseaudio started over it... so i don't know
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: and i know that from amixer, was just saying the things i checked in when i got the paste
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: beyond that i don't know anything more
kingbeast open alsa mixer
#ubuntu  kingbeast| causasui, pm
kingbeast does it have a MM under any of the meters?
kingbeast in between the 70 and the meter is there a MM
kingbeast or 00?
kingbeast ok
kingbeast hit F6 and screenshot it for me
##linux  [R]| causasui: unmute it
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: speaker-test  #any sound?
##linux  pingfloyd| causasui: make sure not channels are muted
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: as an aside; triple check possible MUTE settings, even in DE; pkill pulse ; pkill gstreamer  --- and make sure wires for spkrs are hooked into proper jacks
##linux  pingfloyd| causasui: no*
kingbeast are you using hdmi?
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: aplay /usr/share/sound/alsa/*  #any sound?
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: ouch; lsmod | egrep 'pcm|oss'
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: dude, get some better fonts :-P
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: is snd_pcm_oss and snd_mixer_oss loaded?
kingbeast but are you using hdmi?
kingbeast or the dvi?
kingbeast either way your going to have to blacklist the nvidia card
kingbeast do lspci in a terminal
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: all you had to do is say Y/N
kingbeast or better yet copy and paste this in it: lspci | grep audio
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: speaker-test #no audio?
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: aplay -L   #pastebin
kingbeast capitallize the A in audio
kingbeast I'm thinking it's conflicting with the nvidia audio
kingbeast I'd try blacklisting the nvidia audio driver and see if it starts working, but you will have to reboot after doing that
kingbeast do you have a DE installed yet?
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: ok, i'm stuck, but  PulseAudio Sound Server  #i'd do something with that, like remove it, or use pavucontrol or whatever it is
kingbeast or are you still term only?
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: i don't do pulseaudio
kingbeast causasui 
kingbeast what de though?
kingbeast gnome xfce?
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: lsof | grep pulse ?
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: are you attempting at this time to use hdmi?
kingbeast go to your sound options in it
kingbeast brb
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: stupid question, b/c i wouldn't think anything would show for audio, but check your bios that audio is enabled?
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: ok, here; try this
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: find a known working audio file, then 'aplay -D plughw:0,0 /path/to/file.wav' #try to find a WAV incase
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: i meant much earlier...  wait; ls -l /usr/share/sounds/alsa/  #do files exist?
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: so use those WAVs
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: ouchie
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: now, alter 0,0 -> 0,1  and so on, through 0,4
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: cat /dev/random > /dev/dsp
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: you know how to ctrl-c, right?
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: ok; modprobe snd_pcm_oss and snd_mixer_oss
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: ok, have you worked through all the various plughw:0,1 etc?
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: good - try your windows install too :-)
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: try alsactl init 0
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: alsactl init 0, then run speaker-test?
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: make sure you don't have any other open music playing apps, etc
##linux  xeon-enouf| causasui: well, you got white noise, so... make sure to load those two modules always .. and nothing i can think of here :-(
##linux  pingfloyd| causasui: did you ever try rebooting arch to begin with?
#archlinux  KaiSforza| causasui: he's gone for the moment
#archlinux  KaiSforza| causasui: haha 
#postgresql  pringlescan| causasui, SSDs in general or consumer ones?
pringlescan thanks for taking the time, what do you know?
pringlescan hello
pringlescan no problem, same here, thanks for your time
pringlescan have you done any SSDs in a RAID? it sounds like it's better to do a software RAID because a HW one will bow under the IOP/s
pringlescan thanks
pringlescan thanks for your help
pringlescan thanks
#postgresql  cartan| causasui: yes
#postgresql  cartan| causasui: I always stop the postgres service manually before running the installer. Not sure if that is necessary
#postgresql  cartan| causasui: stop-service postg* in powershell ;-)
#postgresql  Soltis| causasui: Sick freak. Powerpoint?
#rtorrent  pyroscope| causasui:  by patching the source
#postgresql  dserodio| causasui: https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/
#postgresql  vol7ron| causasui: what are you trying to do?
#postgresql  vol7ron| causasui: did that help
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: i have not
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: uname -r ?
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: uname -r
#archlinux  KaiSforza| causasui: poke? what is the output of `pacman -Q linux; uname -r`
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: uname -r
#archlinux  KaiSforza| causasui: pacman -Q linux
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: put it in /etc/modules-load.d/something.conf too, like it says on the virtualbox wiki
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: lsmod |grep -i vbox
#archlinux  nixin| causasui: maybe msg the user or leave a comment i guess
##linux  reisio| causasui: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key#Commands
##linux  reisio| causasui: I don't believe that is an option :)
##linux  reisio| causasui: if you can get to TTY2 or the like (CTRL+ALT+F2), maybe
##linux  reisio| causasui: either you can kill something that is freezing X, or it's dead dead
##linux  reisio| causasui: for certain applications you can possibly save them with reptyr or the like
#archlinux  stqn| causasui: I know what xfce is. I don’t know what restarting xfce means. If you logout then it kills X and all X apps, AFAIK.
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: what specifically do you need to restart?
#xubuntu  David-A| causasui: you can restart the window manager, and the panels too i think. what do you mean restart xfce? logout and login again?
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: try killing just the window manager, then
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: (xfwm4)
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: yes, as long as you DO NOT kill the session manager (xfce4-session)
#archlinux  phrik| causasui: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNaZedAWmlE
#archlinux  stqn| causasui: not required, no
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: imho, it would be for all PCs
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: the ttys are slow mostly just because they're slow
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: kernel developers don't want to touch them. they actually tell horror stories about them
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: yeah, it's more-or-less normal
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: if you work in ttys a lot, try kmscon
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: reset in which way?
#archlinux  Earnestly| causasui: `htop` will make you life much easier
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: kill that 'bash' process
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: you mean what fields have changed?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: hstore(NEW) - hstore(OLD)
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: what do you mean?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: ok, so  select hstore(t1) - hstore(t2) from table t1, table t2 where t1.id=? and t2.id=?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: hstore(row_value) turns a row into an hstore
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: only if you want to
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: suppose you want to compare the rows with id=1 and id=2
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: select hstore(t1) - hstore(t2) from table t1, table t2 where t1.id=1 and t2.id=2;
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: that'll show the values in the id=1 row that aren't the same in the id=2 row
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: if you want symmetry, do the subtraction the other way too
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: if you have more than two rows it's a bit harder.
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: you need the self-join as I showed above
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: note that my example assumes one table, not two - it just uses two aliases
#irssi  billnye| causasui: /help channel
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: /run, /sys, /tmp
#archlinux  weecrapz| causasui /sys and lost+found
##linux  peetaur2| causasui: /media, /tmp and /sys
#archlinux  brain0| causasui: /var/tmp/
#archlinux  brain0| causasui: maybe some more stuff in /var/
##linux  ayecee| causasui: doesn't duplicity have an option to stick to one filesystem?
#archlinux  sykopomp| causasui: /bin, /usr, /lib probably, too
#archlinux  sykopomp| causasui: I would exclude all of /var, and add specific things to the backup as you need them.
##linux  socomm| causasui: do you need full /usr? you'll probably need /etc
#archlinux  brain0| causasui: /var/spool/ is probably unnecessary, too
#archlinux  brain0| causasui: oh, /var/cache/ is not important either
##linux  socomm| causasui: and your data, wherever its kept /var/www/ /var/lib/mysql - and so on
#archlinux  sykopomp| causasui: reinstall!
##linux  socomm| causasui: that might be waste of storage, I generally only backup config and data directories
#archlinux  sykopomp| causasui: basically
#archlinux  kristof| causasui: Yes. Not only will those files be outdated if you're backing up /usr and /bin, but it also saves space. Craft your own little install script, I dunno.
#archlinux  kristof| causasui: Go for it hombre
#archlinux  kristof| causasui: Why don't you have /sbin in there?
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui:  sp_RENAME 'TableName.[OldColumnName]' , '[NewColumnName]', 'COLUMN'
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: ALTER TABLE tablename RENAME COLUMN OldName TO NewName
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: ALTER TABLE tablename RENAME OldName TO NewName
#wikipedia-en  duh| causasui: #wikimedia-otrs
#wikimedia-otrs +RD| causasui: Hi...um, on the wiki itself?
#irssi  pxb| causasui: Just /hilight
#irssi  billnye| causasui: yep, use /hilight :)
#foobar2000 +WilliamC| causasui, there is one called Vorbisgain
#foobar2000 +WilliamC| causasui, I'd try it.
#foobar2000 +ivan| causasui: uh just do a binary diff
#foobar2000 +ivan| causasui: yeah
#foobar2000 +WilliamC| causasui, pretty much the only job you can get doing that is teaching it.
#postgresql  Mara| causasui: now there`s a problem :D
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: defaults don't, but he already fixed those
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: you mean you're looking for a specific key/value combo?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: hstorecol @> hstore('key','val')   or   hstorecol->'key' = 'val'
#xfce  Leoneof| causasui: wow!, looks like explorer.exe in Windows, thank you!
#xfce  Leoneof| causasui: xfe is good, but doesn't support UTF-8 for filenames :/
#foobar2000 +diminish| causasui: that's silly, most people don't give a fuck about source, how does that help adoption
#postgresql  joevandyk| causasui: well, yes, but i don't think that helps?

##linux  ananke| causasui: not to mention, are you asking about external or internal ip?
##linux  kaneda^| causasui, google
##linux  ananke| causasui: your default gateway is likely the ip of your router
##linux  ananke| causasui: netstat -rn

#postgresql  j_wright| causasui: the problem is DROP SEQUENCE isn't picking up the relationship between the field in the table and the sequence to prevent dropping the sequence
#postgresql  munderwo-work| causasui: Oh I dont have a problem like that. I was asking before if there was some way to workout if a sequence was being used by a table. j_wright was saying just to try dropping it and if its required by something else, then it will complain. I tried that and it didnt, hence where we get to. I've since worked out that they arent being used, but j_wright is confused about why it allowed me to drop a sequence that was being used

#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: isexists
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: and hstore(record) always contains a key for every column of the record
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: (even if the value is null)
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: or, you can do:  NEW := NEW #= hstore('modified_by',user);
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: which will update a modified_by column if one exists, otherwise do nothing
#sql  chilversc| causasui: why?
#sql  chilversc| causasui: if the column doesn't exist, don't put that trigger on the table
#postgresql  agliodbs| causasui: don't you love how as soon as you post a question, you figure out what the answer is?
#postgresql  agliodbs| causasui: maybe hstore(modified_date) isn't defined?
#postgresql  agliodbs| causasui: isdefined is checking the hstore column to see if it has that attribute
#postgresql  agliodbs| causasui: modified_date would also be undefined if it's NULL
#postgresql  supplicant| causasui: you might need quotes?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: 'modified_date'
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: why isdefined rather than ?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: also, don't repeatedly call hstore() on the same record, just do it once
#postgresql  agliodbs| causasui: he's not talking about you.  he just logged on
#postgresql  johto| causasui; have you tried looking at what's inside the hstore with RAISE NOTICE?
#pidgin  EionRobb| causasui: if you're on windows, I can build a new dll for you which puts buddies into an OkCupid group instead of Buddies.  If you're on Linux then you can script it to move the buddies around using dbus
##linux  ayecee| causasui: regular kill is fine, without the -9
##linux  raboof| causasui: kill it without '-9', I suppose

#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: pacman -Syu 
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: pastebin the errros somwehere other than pastebin.com
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: so remove it
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: pacman -Sii qt4
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: remove the other package as well, then update, then reinstall them if you want them 
#archlinux  thrice`| causasui, all of the official packages have this done
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: pacman -Sii qt
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: then you'd notice 
#archlinux  Boohbah| causasui: you could comment on the aur page requesting the maintainer to update the package.
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: qt4 fucking replaces it
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: no i said remove the shit that depends on QT
#archlinux  Boohbah| causasui: or, you know, edit the PKGBUILD yourself
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: and edit the depends in the pkgbuilds to qtfucking4
#archlinux  Boohbah| causasui: i hope not
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: no. if that were the case the wtf is the point of adopting 
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: rebuild cower.
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: user error, see the first url in the topic
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: rebuild it, user is required to rebuild aur packages on soname bumps
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: no, it depends on libarchive

#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: comments
#archlinux  ZekeS| causasui: is it my package? ;-;
#archlinux  gtmanfred| causasui: if they don't respond in 2 weeks you can ask to have it disowned on aur-general
#archlinux  stqn| causasui: pacman -Ss git | grep --word-regexp 'git'   … not clean but makes the list smaller
#archlinux  Apsu`| causasui: If you read the description in pacman -Sh, you'll see -Ss is a regex search
#archlinux  Apsu`| causasui: pacman -Ss ^git$
#regex  Kingpin13| causasui, yeah, I would say so. Why, is it giving you problems?
#archlinux  Apsu`| causasui: Use an intelligent AUR helper, like cower and/or meat
#archlinux  Apsu`| causasui: man cower, read the section on -s
#archlinux  Apsu`| causasui: The answer is read the information, understand what it means, use the feature accordingly :P
#regex  rewt| causasui, [^A-z] probably doesn't do what you think it does

#mumble  Frymaster| causasui: can you give me the ip:port so I can try?
#mumble  Frymaster| causasui: out of curiosity, do you still have the ability to register other people? should be in the right-click menu, I think (there's no one online atm who isn't registered in my server)
##linux  chvnx| causasui: I manually mount to dirs in /mnt, and automount to /media
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: you can put tmux in tmux in tmux
#archlinux  roknir| causasui: not really.  that's how i would un-minimize a minimized window.  it's not even specific to application either.
#terminator  Ng| causasui: you want to give focus to it while it's minimised?
#archlinux  webspid0r| causasui: I use scratchpads for that :>
#archlinux  Earnestly| causasui: Not that I recommended what you're doing personally; but you can always steal the logic from the urxvt wiki article which contains a section for doing just that using xdotool
#archlinux  webspid0r| causasui: using xdotool will always be a hack
#archlinux  webspid0r| causasui: yeah, I'd do it that way
#archlinux  Toost_Inc| Causasui: Another option would be to install terra

#sql  chilversc| causasui: and if a unique constraint over item_number won't work, what defines an item_number as being a duplicate?
#sql  chilversc| causasui: I'd probably have it the other way around, order_id, item_number, as I'd guess that order_id is going to be more selective here

#archlinux  grawity| causasui: if you unchecked the Trash option, it won't use trash anyweay
#archlinux  Nahiyan| causasui, try chattr +i /path/to/.Trash
#archlinux  Nahiyan| causasui, did you chattr +i?
#archlinux  Nahiyan| causasui, mm. BTW, do you have dnsmasq caching your DNS?
#archlinux  Nahiyan| causasui, I found out something interesting, if you put ::1/127.0.0.1 in resolv.conf, at the start, applications should use that. dnsmasq can read resolv.conf and will ignore those
#archlinux  Nahiyan| causasui, yeah

#archlinux  Earnestly| causasui: If you can't use pulseaudio, understandably, your only other valid option is alsa. You can try ossv4, but it's sort of dead.

#archlinux  Earnestly| causasui: Oh heh, indeed that was a long time ago
#archlinux  eto| causasui: give it a try - you ahve nothing to lose
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: alsa can do that. I have a separate headset for my voice chat and speakers for game noises.
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: nope, but there's a few out there for asoundrc
#archlinux  Earnestly| causasui: Yeah, unfortuantely the handling of pulseaudio by both ubuntu and opensuse (and probably others) is why you see all this hatred for pulseaudio persisting even today
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: because I don't need to switch it on the fly? What does that even mean? 
#archlinux  Earnestly| causasui: good luck. Keep in mind the new locations for daemon.conf and default.pa is ~/.config/pulse/foo. (Or XDG_CONFIG_HOME) if you want to tinker
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: i don't unplug my sound card while i'm playing a game
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: go futz around with pulseaudio then
#archlinux  buhman| causasui: you can still mount root from there
#archlinux  buhman| causasui: I did

#archlinux  Earnestly| causasui: http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/pa-in-ubuntu.html
#archlinux  Earnestly| causasui: Indeed, if you don't like the way a back is being handled, it's almost effortless to do it yourself with abs or just the git repos

##linux  qman__| causasui, with key-based authentication, the client holds the private key, which it uses to authenticate against the public key, stored on the server; both pieces are needed
#openssh  BasketCase| causasui: more than one authentication type can be enabled.  Any that are allowed satisfy it.
#pidgin  Necrosporus| causasui, same is true for pidgin
#pidgin  datallah| causasui: A plugin could be written to do that
#postgresql  pzn| causasui, I agree
#postgresql  Walex| causasui: it is actually a lot better than people think. For example the cool design-by-graph etc.
#postgresql  adelgado| causasui: You're making the world a better place.
#postgresql  Walex| causasui: use MS-Access as a frontend to PostgreSQL? Can be done fairly easily...
#postgresql  Walex| causasui: ahhh I had misunderstood...
#postgresql  Walex| causasui: doesn't Django impose its own satanic idea of data modeling as in something not too different from form == table?
#openssh  hendry| causasui: i wonder what such a cronjob would look like
#archlinux  velcroshooz| causasui: you have the lib32 version of your video driver installed?
#archlinux  velcroshooz| causasui: probably the reason for the error
#archlinux  velcroshooz| causasui: probably, i doubt that is 64 bit capable either
#archlinux  velcroshooz| causasui: nvidia, intel, ati?
#archlinux  velcroshooz| causasui: lib32-nvidia-utils then if you are on the proprietary driver
#archlinux  velcroshooz| causasui: Y - the nvidia one wil provide it
#archlinux  velcroshooz| causasui: yeah i dont know much about redshift, not sure on that one
#archlinux  velcroshooz| causasui: possibly limited to what xorg is running at? only guessing
#archlinux  velcroshooz| causasui: nvidia-setting maybe, i havent looked into it really
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: that guys an idiot
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: what video device are you running?
#archlinux  cinelli| causasui: lspci -k |& curl -F sprunge=@- sprunge.us

#mumble  Natenom| causasui: Does the user who tries to register have a certificate?
#mumble @mkrautz| causasui: hmm, seems fine. but note that users can only register if they're connected with a client certificate.
#mumble  Clientkill| causasui: what's the problem?
#mumble @mkrautz| causasui: alright, I just wanted to make sure you knew that. :)
#mumble @mkrautz| causasui: it's deny traverse that's causing the issue
#mumble @mkrautz| causasui: if you create another @all entry on the root channel, you can set it to only apply to sub channels, adn have your -traverse in there
#mumble  Svedrin| causasui, no need to restart murmur

#bash  yitz_| causasui: you may want to test the cd command actually worked, too. Maybe cd "$1" && ls

#freenode +jtrucks| causasui: yup. lazy. ;)
##linux  johnny_|_| causasui: I guess I could do that
#freenode  Dominian| causasui: the latter I would think ;)
#freenode  grawity| causasui: irssi-otr
#freenode  grawity| causasui: openssl req -new -x509 -subj "/O=freenode/CN=causasui" -key ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out mycert.pem
#freenode  grawity| causasui: it uses neither
#freenode  grawity| causasui: although if you use SSL, it's really somewhat better to use a new key with -newkey rsa:4096 instead of re-using your SSH key
#freenode  grawity| causasui: it just doesn't make sense to reuse it
#freenode  grawity| causasui: because they are different protocols
#freenode  grawity| causasui: if you are talking about re-using your SSH RSA keypair for the SSL certificate, then the answer is that it gives absolutely no advantages over just creating a new one
#freenode  grawity| causasui: and using separate keypairs for separate protocols can increase security if one protocol is found to use the keypairs incorrectly
#freenode  grawity| causasui: for example, SSHv1 (now long abandoned) performed public-key authentication in a somewhat risky way
#freenode  grawity| causasui: of course, that's really unlikely for SSHv2 and TLSv1 (which is how SSL called these days), so the short answer is just that there's no point in reusing the same key.
#freenode  grawity| causasui: but this was about using SSH authentication key for TLS authentication
#freenode  grawity| causasui: more generally, if you try to reuse the same key for both signing and encryption, for example, it *can* be risky

#postgresql  atrius| causasui: do you care which row?
#postgresql  atrius| causasui: why not just 'limit X' then?
#postgresql  atrius| causasui: i don't believe so. LIMIT just limits the returned result set
#postgresql  atrius| causasui: true :)
#postgresql  sgfgdf| causasui, this query will return how many records you have in the valmont table.
#postgresql  sgfgdf| causasui, we are still talking about the whole select not only the subquery, right?
#postgresql  sgfgdf| causasui, you don't have WHERE clause on the outer SELECT.
#sql  plushy| causasui: just get rid of the outer query
#postgresql  sgfgdf| causasui, well why then you don't remove the outer query and leave only the subquery? it should return one row.
#postgresql  Croves| causasui: I don't think that's a good idea :P
#postgresql  Croves| causasui: Not that big... I think I'll need to insert something like 1000 rows at once
#postgresql  sgfgdf| causasui, well then remove "from legacy.valmont" and add as much subqueries as you want. like so -- select (select 1), (select 2), (select 3);
#postgresql  sgfgdf| causasui, you're welcome ;)

#postgresql  mastermind| causasui: hmm
#postgresql  mastermind| causasui: what postgresql installer are you actually using?
#postgresql  mastermind| causasui: hrm - no idea what that actually correlates too
#postgresql  mastermind| causasui: so you are actually using the 9.2.4-1 installer?
#archlinux  gwash| causasui, what about 'wicked cool'?
#archlinux  AbortRetryFail| causasui: if systemd and polkit are set up right, you should be able to just do 'reboot' 
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, I've seen that before, what distro are you running?
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, ah wait, it's not the same. My problem was that pulseaudio package was amd64 and the pulseaudio-esound-compat was i386. This is something different.
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, hmm, those rows are not related, are they? One is 45 minutes after the other.
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, and two different pulseaudio processes
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, netstat -a would give you who is currently binding to that port
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, also check /tmp/.esd-<user>/socket
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, maybe it's a stale file. Can you delete it and then try starting pulseaudio again?
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, or check which process has it opened
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, "sudo fuser -v /tmp/esd-<user>/socket"
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, is your /tmp persistent across reboots?
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, I looked in the source code. Took a while to find it, I first thought it was port 16001/tcp, but then I saw it was a unix socket instead
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, fuser -v for that socket?
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, is 11437 the currently running pulseaudio or do you have two, one 11437 and one 23179 ?
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, in short, if you delete  the .pulse directory, you need to restart pulseaudio afterwards
#pulseaudio  mue| causasui: experience shows that ppl are doing this as a troubleshooting measure
#pulseaudio  mue| causasui: i am not
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, no, because you seem to have already tried it and it didn't help, it's unlikely to help if you do it again
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, if you're pretty new, maybe try a simpler distro such as Ubuntu? PulseAudio packaging is quite complex and I don't know if archlinux got all the pieces right
#pulseaudio  diwic| causasui, but take that opinion with a grain of salt, since I work for Canonical :-)
#pulseaudio  nevyn| causasui: so what bit is broken?
#archlinux  Thra11| causasui, Have you dealt with your .pacnew files ?

#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: read the manual chapters on backup/restore and replication/ha
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: or 0 and -1 :P
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: AH
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: 0 is true on Ruby
#archlinux  Kwpolska| causasui: I am not an idiot.
#archlinux  Kwpolska| causasui: chromium doesn’t have pepper flash by default?
#archlinux  Kwpolska| causasui: I didn't know of the chromium-pepper-flash thing.
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: define broken as shit
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: you mean the outdated pkgbuild?
#archlinux  zeep| causasui: i used yaourt when i first switched to aur, then packer, then pacaur
#archlinux  zeep| causasui: *switched to arch
#archlinux  Earnestly| causasui: You're not wrong
#archlinux  Earnestly| causasui: But the man page and the conf file (comments) detail how to use it. It's not enabled by default
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: yes
#archlinux  sledgehammer| causasui, why are you patching systemd?
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: then wtf do you mean
#archlinux  sledgehammer| causasui, you're just doing -Syu?
#archlinux  sledgehammer| causasui, so why didn't you say so? just go ahead, there are no special issues
#bash  greybot| causasui: "USE MORE QUOTES!" and "Double quote" _every_ expansion, as well as anything that could possibly contain a special character, e.g. "$var", "$@", "${array[@]}", "$(command)". Bash treats everything within 'single quotes' as literal. Learn the difference between ' and " and `. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Arguments>, <http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/words>, <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes> and <http://mywik
#bash  greybot| causasui: Consistently use [[ .. ]] to test strings or files, (( .. )) to test numbers or arithmetics and ''if COMMAND'' to test exit status. Do *NOT* use [ .. ] in bash, *only* in sh. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/tests and http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/TestsAndConditionals. Also see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031 for the difference between [ and [[
#bash  nDuff| causasui: (( status != 0 ))
#bash  nDuff| causasui: ...or, [ "$status" -ne 0 ], but that'll fail for status being unset or an empty string, which is your current situation.
#bash  nDuff| causasui: Where do you set the status variable, anyhow?
#bash  nDuff| causasui: ...if so, you probably shouldn't be using diff at all; it's a much more slow/expensive tool than you need if you just want to know if two files are identical.
#bash  nDuff| causasui: if ! cmp -s "$file1" "$file2"; then echo "Files are different"; else echo "Files are identical"; fi
#bash  nDuff| causasui: for future note, the exit status of the last command is $?, not $status
#bash  nDuff| causasui: ...but it's better to just use if to test directly.
#bash  nDuff| causasui: ^^ works for me.
#bash  nDuff| causasui: Where are you setting the file1 and file2 variables?
#bash  nDuff| causasui: Arguments are of the form "$1", "$2", etc.
#bash  nDuff| causasui: ...so no, those aren't arguments.
#bash  greybot| causasui: ''set -x'' (or ''bash -x yourscript'') makes bash output the command name and arguments that it will run (after parsing and expansion). Set it by starting a script with ''bash -x ./myscript'' or putting ''set -x'' before the code to debug. ''set +x'' turns this off.

#postgresql  intgr| causasui: The trigger fires, but any changes it made to the database will be rolled back along with the containing transaction.
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: as a rule you don't ever want to join on a table _and_ query it in correlated subselects
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: remove the join
#sql  \mSg| causasui, sounds like one of the other tables in the FROM has multiple records that join to royal_interaction
##sed  geirha| causasui: because it's ambigous otherwise
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: no
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: it is true that null is not true, correct?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: select b, not b, b is not true from (values (false),(true),(null)) v(b);
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: the result is true
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: because it is true that null is not true
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: true and null is null, because it's (true and unknown)
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: and the result of (true and unknown) is obviously unknown
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: whereas, say, (false and unknown) is false
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, um, is it less broken than oracle's in any significant way? i'm thinking no way if it's even advertised as a drop-in replacement
#postgresql  davidfetter| causasui, mr. raymond knew about neither cathedrals nor bazaars. i take his ignorant bloviating for what it's worth :P
#bash  Riviera| causasui: [[ $1 = "" ]];  note that you'd use $# to check for the amount of arguments passed.
#bash  greybot| causasui: yup: $# expands to the number of arguments, not counting $0.
#bash  greybot| causasui: Avoid literal terminal sequences in your code: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/037 -- How can I print text in various colors?
#bash  Riviera| causasui: I don't quite understand where sed's place is your goal is, though.  (As an aside, there is a dedicated channel for sed:  ##sed)
#bash  Riviera| causasui: nice then :)  The sed remark was more for potential future issues with sed :)
#bash  Riviera| causasui: [[ -t 2 ]] tests if fd 2 (stderr) is a tty.
#bash  Riviera| causasui: the command after && is executed if the [[ .. ]] command is true.
#bash  nDuff| causasui: && is a logical AND operation. Thus, foo && bar returns true if both foo and bar are true.
#bash  nDuff| causasui: Now, if foo is false, then the outcome of the logical operation MUST be false, so there's no reason to evaluate bar.
#bash  nDuff| causasui: Nothing wrong with using it that way.
#bash  nDuff| causasui: I don't think calling it "shorthand" _or_ a "shortcut" is valid. Different bits of syntax have their own semantics, and if you think of one of them as just a different way of writing the other, you're going to get in trouble.
#bash  nDuff| causasui: ...though, to be fair, the position I'm taking is less defensible in the case with no else block.

##linux  the_file| causasui: slackware
##linux  the_file| causasui: yes because the terminal is a square, it has no round corners
#regex  Billiard_| causasui: perhaps
#bash  kolbe| causasui: unset cd
##hardware  compdoc| causasui, yeah, but most utils will set it automatically these days
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: Both.
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: in fact, users cannot *ever* create device nodes
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: there will be, since /dev is a separate filesystem
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: wait am moment
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: I *think* you're misunderstanding how nodev works
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: ah, yeah, that
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: yeah, nodev prevents that one
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: depends on where you put it
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: if you use the option for removable disks only, then there's no cost
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: you mean removable disks aren't physical? :P
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: unless its /, there's no need to be able to mount /dev on it
#archlinux  heftig| causasui: the answer is to mount removables with nodev
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: Firewire counts as "removable".
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: if you add nodev to /, you can't mount /dev
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: and you need /dev
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: by mounting removables with nodev, like heftig JUST said
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: yes
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: on that filesystem, more precisely
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: nodev means you can't use mknod
#archlinux  heftig| causasui: nosuid,nodev
#archlinux  heftig| causasui: don't care about ext4
#archlinux  heftig| causasui: btrfs
#archlinux  heftig| causasui: no, but I use it anyway
#archlinux  buhman| causasui: hell no
#archlinux  buhman| causasui: btrfs will work flawlessly up until the point where if it fails people will get fired and/or assasinated.
#archlinux  buhman| causasui: then it burps and farts all over the place.
#archlinux  buhman| causasui: in particular, qgroups have been buggy since their introduction in 3.6
#archlinux  buhman| causasui: sounds about right
#archlinux  buhman| causasui: I was nearly fired over it, believe it or not
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, some arch users maybe, we aren't all 'Latest and greatest' junkies you know, there's many other reasons to use arch
#archlinux  buhman| causasui: oh, don't get me wrong, I still use it, the performance benifits can't be ignored
#archlinux  buhman| causasui: btrfs can do it in place
#archlinux  buhman| causasui: the reverse operation is completely not possible
#archlinux  buhman| causasui: well, once you delete the snapshot
#irssi  billnye| causasui: probably best way is via SASL

#android  Shizuo| causasui: No
#android  Khaytsus| causasui: openvpn
#android  CW`| causasui:  Pepper flash on Chrome sucks and unless you have disabled your Google updates over the past 3 months or so, it's gone.
#android  CW`| causasui:  Completely different apps but I like System Tuner's backup/restore features much better.
#archlinux  jokke| causasui: you can check pacman -Q linux
#archlinux  jokke| causasui: then just compare it with what uname -a gives you
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: journals are on by default...
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: oh, in that sense, yes
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: depends. journal will write everything to the journal before writing to the filesystem. ordered will alaternate this between file and then the metadata
#archlinux  Boohbah| causasui: it's pretty crazy to run without a journal
#archlinux  Boohbah| causasui: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_file_system
#irssi  yitz_| causasui: /layout save and /save
#irssi  yitz_| causasui: the layout one isn't. The save may or may not be. There's a setting for it
##linux  zmode| causasui: man 5 fstab
##linux  zmode| causasui: no, it says allow. granting
##linux  ohcanada| causasui: the "owner" will be assigned after the mount, to the mountpoint
##linux  BlastHardcheese| causasui: the owner of a mounted mountpoint is always root unless you allow regular users to mount the volume, with the user/users options
##linux  ohcanada| causasui: what are you trying to do, briefly
##linux  ohcanada| causasui: BlastHardcheese is right about udev. another route you could try is to add your user to the "disk" group, if such a thing exists on your system. it is less secure, since the user could mount anything, but less hassle to configure
#archlinux  vodik| causasui » any guess why this fstab ruins me if i uncomment the commented UIDs?
##linux  pem3v78| causasui: that was for you
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: on sysv, without a root entry, afaik, root will remain readonly
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: thats correct
#archlinux  velcroshooz| causasui: yes, it can, and yes, thats a good idea ;)
#archlinux  velcroshooz| causasui: it can
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: man pacman
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: seriously
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: what are you trying to hold back btw?
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: why?
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: that might break a shitton of stuff......
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: stop using arch
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, no this is Spaaaaaataaaaa! ;)
#archlinux  Jesin| causasui: they fixed it I thought?
#archlinux  Jesin| causasui: if you're talking about the skype segfaults
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, point is holding back packages is *almost* always not the right solution, and certainly not in any kind of long term
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, for example you could tun skype in a vm
#archlinux  Jesin| causasui: huh, my chromium hasn't had any issues
#archlinux  Jesin| causasui: the only bug I had was skype (note: I use xfce, not gnome)
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, is it broken though? I don't think i've had any problems
#archlinux  MrElendig| causasui: latest glib works fine
#archlinux  Jesin| causasui: they released a fix within less than a day after the broken version came out.
#archlinux  Jesin| causasui: keep in mind, my only issue was with skype, though.
#archlinux  Jesin| causasui: I don't use gnome.
#archlinux  Jesin| causasui: So maybe you should have xfce or something as a backup.
#archlinux  Jesin| causasui: what gnome apps do you use?
#archlinux  ak5| causasui: yes, it would be weird otherwise
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: /invite rms
#archlinux  ak5| causasui: blargh
#archlinux  jkirby| causasui: yep
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, please supply a pasete(bin) of exact error output
#archlinux  d_garbage| causasui, this is important precisely because you may be overlooking something that others might spot
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: something like that
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: then you can whop an  insert into legacy.quote_log ...  in front of that
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: and did it work?
#postgresql  RhodiumToad| causasui: what values are null?
#bash  Riviera| causasui: but the prompting is done by the remote shell.
#bash  Riviera| causasui: is it not
#bash  Riviera| causasui: Well, any environment variables aside (and sure, using screen changes things), I don't even understand the task.
#bash  Riviera| causasui: You want to change prompt settings depending on whether you're using ssh or not.  Well, ssh does not show a prompt, shells do, and when you're logged in anywhere via ssh it's the remote shell that draws the prompt.
#bash  Riviera| causasui: So you'll want to detect that server-side, won't you?
#bash  Riviera| causasui: When you work at the server locally the prompt should be different than when you're logged in through a network?
#bash  Riviera| causasui: So, okay.  First get it to work without screen, you should maybe prefer SSH_CLIENT.
#bash  Riviera| causasui: but the ssh docs document their environment variables quite well.  So, check if these are set.
#bash  Riviera| causasui: Now a few words about screen:
#bash  Riviera| causasui: Imagine you have a shell session running inside of screen.  You start it while sitting in front of the server, locally.  You re-attach to it remotely, e.g. from home.
#bash  Riviera| causasui: You want a different prompt in both cases.  The problem is:  The environment of the shell session stays the same inside of screen.  You need a way to circumvent this.
#bash  Riviera| causasui: Now, before we go on I would like to point out that this exact issue is the reason people have the hostnames in their prompts; that'd not suffice?
#bash  Riviera| causasui: Yup, "of course not."
#bash  Riviera| causasui: Do you understand why?
#bash  Riviera| causasui: (I met people who suffer from similar problems ... and renamed commands like shutdown to shutdown_hostname, to ... avoid certain problems.:))
#bash  Riviera| causasui: no, because the process inside of screen keeps the environment it was started with.
#bash  Riviera| causasui: There are tricks around that.
#bash  Riviera| causasui: Nah, well, we could hack something together, but I'd suggest you ask in #screen (or #tmux), there is code available that does all that for you.
#bash  Riviera| causasui: I'll also try searching the internet, give me two minutes. :)
#bash  Riviera| causasui: i didn't read these, they might suck:  http://pastie.org/pastes/7725869/text
#bash  Riviera| causasui: feel free to ask me again if neither these links nor #screen help; i'd hack something together.
#screen  jwhisnant| causasui: could you export that in .bashrc or whatever your shell is?
#bash  Riviera| causasui: not quite :)
#bash  Riviera| causasui: you only remove slashes here
#bash  Riviera| causasui: not really; how'd exactly would you like to use that:  random_command =something= ?
#bash  David-A| causasui: maybe you'd already rolled your own, hiding the huge one-liner in a function:
#bash  David-A| causasui: yes, $1 is a command with each of $2...$n applied one at a time until success. $1 is unquoted so the command can have initial args (but then of course the command and the initial args can not have space and other special chars in them)
#bash  Riviera| causasui: no.
#bash  robottinosino| causasui: I was always in favour of skills-based RPG Vs experience points/level systems
#archlinux  vodik| causasui: it just remembers the hostmask
#archlinux  Boohbah| causasui: if you put your ip in your hostmask that's what you get
#bash  robottinosino| causasui: or.. kill a rabbit and suddenly speak "elven"
#archlinux  grawity| causasui: if you took a closer look at this channel, you'd see that IRC itself spits out people's IP addresses, e.g. gwash

#wikipedia-en-admins  Dragonfly6-7| causasui - I don't use facebook.
#wikipedia-en-admins  NotASpy| causasui: I know it's cliched but there's a lot of people on WP who are somewhere on the autistic spectrum, there's lots of editors who plod very methodically through lists, categories, do things in date order, who like things to be very neat and tidy. Wikipedia offers more opportunities for lists, routines and things. 
##linux @DLange| causasui: perhaps non-secure terminal (can't be locked for passphrase input). Try on a console.
##crypto  sarnold| causasui: I wonder... perhaps it is trying to use getpass(3) to ask you for a password but you do not have a terminal available (as can sometimes happen with ssh...)
#archlinux  danking| causasui: Random thought, did you try with a capital O?
##crypto  sarnold| causasui: I kinda doubt it. keys are identified by fingerprints.
##crypto  K_F| causasui: oh, if you're at an external terminal, make sure you're using the proper pinentry as well
##crypto  K_F| causasui: the error indicate an issue with gpg-agent and pinentry (through libassuan)

#bash  falconindy| causasui: quoting problem. you can't escape single quotes within single quotes
#bash  Riviera| causasui: yup, better way would be to only execute it once.
#bash  Riviera| causasui: no -e will change broken quoting.
#git  twb| causasui: you can put stuff in your .gitconfig to stop people committing stupid EOLs
##sed  dualbus| causasui: could you be more specific?
##sed  dualbus| causasui: then you can "branch" after a succesful substitution
##sed  dualbus| causasui: `t' takes an optional tag name to know where it should jump, but the default is to skip every other case.
##sed  dualbus| causasui: all other cases. Branch to the end, skipping the rest.
##sed  dualbus| causasui: hehe
##sed  dualbus| causasui: a problematic situation is where you want a -> b, and b -> c, and your input is ab, which should end up as bc.
##sed  dualbus| causasui: perfect then. If it were an issue, you could reorder the transformations, so b -> c is always before a -> b, and so on.
##sed  dualbus| causasui: Uhm, the syntax for t?
##sed  dualbus| causasui: nah, the jumps are between code instructions. The data stays the same.
##sed  dualbus| causasui: Exactly!
##sed  dualbus| causasui: nice.
##sed  dualbus| causasui: Yep, you can get really complex loops with `t' and `b'.
##sed  dualbus| causasui: you're welcome. Some people claim sed is Turing-complete, which means that you can theoretically compute anything you want in sed, with some practical limitations.
